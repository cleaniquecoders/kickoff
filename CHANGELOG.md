  // ✅ Correct
$this->dispatch('toast',
    type: 'success',
    message: 'Success!',
    duration: 3000
);

// ❌ Old (incorrect)
$this->dispatch('toast', [
    'type' => 'success',
    'message' => 'Success!'
]);

  ```

2. Settings: Settings now persist to .env file automatically. No database table needed.
3. Branding: The app logo now uses `config('app.name')` automatically.

## Livewire Flux Integration & Development Tooling  - 2025-11-08

### 📋 Summary

The **version 1.4.0** introduces Livewire Flux package integration, refactors card components to use a new structured approach, and adds a comprehensive sandbox testing environment with Laravel Workbench. This represents a significant frontend modernization and a major improvement to the package development workflow.

### 📥 Installation

```bash
composer global require cleaniquecoders/kickoff


```
### 🔗 Links

- **Full Changelog:** https://github.com/cleaniquecoders/kickoff/releases/tag/v1.4.0
- **Repository:** https://github.com/cleaniquecoders/kickoff

### 🎯 Type of Change

- ✨ Feature: Livewire Flux package integration
- 🔧 Refactor: Card component restructuring
- 🛠️ **Dev Tools: Sandbox testing environment**
- 📝 Documentation: Icon component additions

### 🔨 Technical Changes

#### 1. **Sandbox Testing Environment** ⭐ NEW

- **New Script**: sandbox - Automated testing utility for package development
- **Purpose**: Test `kickoff start` repeatedly without polluting git history
- **Git Integration**: Automatically manages `skip-worktree` flag for test-output
- **Test Directory**: sandbox - Isolated Laravel project for testing

**Sandbox Commands:**

```bash
bin/sandbox run          # Create fresh Laravel app + run kickoff start
bin/sandbox reset        # Delete sandbox and start clean


```
**Key Features:**

- **Automated Workflow**: Creates Laravel app, applies kickoff, ready for inspection
- **Git-Safe**: Uses `skip-worktree` to prevent accidental commits of test files
- **Repeatable**: Fast iteration cycle for stub testing
- **Smart Cleanup**: Removes old sandbox before creating new one
- **Validation**: Checks for required Laravel installer and kickoff binary

**Developer Benefits:**

- Test package changes instantly without manual Laravel setup
- No more accidental commits of test-output changes
- Fast feedback loop during stub development
- Consistent testing environment for all contributors

#### 2. **Livewire Flux Integration**

- Integrated Livewire Flux package for enhanced UI components
- Provides modern, reactive component library for Laravel projects
- Improves developer experience with pre-built UI components

#### 3. **Card Component Refactoring**

- Introduced new `x-card` component structure
  
- Separated card into subcomponents:
  
  - `x-card` (main wrapper)
  - `x-card.header` (header section)
  - `x-card.body` (body content)
  - `x-card.footer` (footer actions)
  
- Updated views to use new component structure:
  
  - index.blade.php
  - show.blade.php
  - show.blade.php
  - show.blade.php
  

#### 4. **Icon Components Update**

- Added 13 custom Flux icon components in icon:
  
  - Lucide icon set (arrow-right-left, book-open-text, bug, chevrons-up-down, etc.)
  - System icons (settings, layout-dashboard, shield-check, log-out)
  - Navigation icons (layout-grid, folder-git-2, gauge)
  
- Replaced `@pure` directive with `@blaze` for better Flux compatibility
  
- All icons follow consistent Lucide design patterns
  

#### 5. **Development Tooling**

- **Laravel Workbench**: Added testbench.yaml configuration
- **Purpose**: Package development in isolation
- **Integration**: Enables testing kickoff as if it were installed globally
- Improved contributor onboarding with clear testing path

### 📁 Key Files Added/Modified

**New Files:**

- sandbox - **Sandbox testing script (183 lines)**
- testbench.yaml - Laravel Workbench configuration
- `stubs/resources/views/flux/icon/*.blade.php` - 13 new icon components
- `stubs/resources/views/components/card/*.blade.php` - 3 new subcomponents

**Modified Files:**

- card.blade.php - Main card component
- Multiple admin/livewire views updated with new card structure

### ✅ Benefits

1. **Massive DX Improvement**: Sandbox script reduces testing time from minutes to seconds
2. **Better Component Organization**: Structured card components improve maintainability
3. **Modern UI Framework**: Flux provides enterprise-grade components
4. **Git Hygiene**: Skip-worktree prevents test pollution in git history
5. **Contributor-Friendly**: New developers can test changes immediately with `bin/sandbox run`
6. **Consistency**: Standardized component patterns across the application
7. **Professional Workflow**: Matches industry best practices for package development

### 🧪 Testing Workflow

**Before (Manual):**

```bash
# 5-10 minutes per test cycle
cd ~/Projects
laravel new test-project
cd test-project
# manually edit composer.json to add local kickoff
composer install
kickoff start owner project
# inspect changes
# delete entire project
# repeat


```
**After (Automated):**

```bash
# 30 seconds per test cycle
bin/sandbox run          # Creates Laravel + applies kickoff
# inspect test-output/sandbox
bin/sandbox reset        # Clean slate
# repeat instantly


```
**Testing the Sandbox:**

```bash
# Create fresh Laravel app and apply kickoff
bin/sandbox run

# Inspect the generated project
cd test-output/sandbox
# create a database in mysql named `sandbox`


```
Then create tables & seed data:

```bash
php artisan reload:db


```
Run the sandbox app:

```bash
npm run build
php artisan serve


```
To clean up sandbox, run:

```bash
bin/sandbox reset


```
### 📦 Dependencies

### 🔄 Migration Path

**For Package Contributors:**

- Use `bin/sandbox run` instead of manual Laravel project creation
- Test-output directory automatically managed with skip-worktree

**For Generated Projects:**

1. Update card usage from single component to structured format
2. Replace `@pure` with `@blaze` in custom icon components
3. Leverage new Flux components for enhanced UI features

- Inline comments in sandbox explain each command
- Usage instructions at script header
- Error messages guide missing dependencies

**Component Documentation:**

**For Contributors:**

- New testing workflow via sandbox script (old manual method still works)
- Test-output directory now ignored with skip-worktree

### 💡 Developer Experience Highlights

**Sandbox Script Innovation:**

- Solves the long-standing problem of testing package output
- Prevents "oops, committed test files" incidents
- Makes TDD possible for stub development
- Reduces barrier to contribution
- Professional package development workflow

**Impact on Development Speed:**

- **Before**: ~10 min per test iteration (manual setup/teardown)
- **After**: ~30 sec per test iteration (automated)
- **Time Saved**: ~95% reduction in testing overhead
- **Result**: More iterations = better quality stubs
