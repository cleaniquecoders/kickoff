# Documentation

Welcome to the Kickoff documentation. This guide will help you understand, use, and contribute to the
Kickoff Laravel project bootstrap tool.

## Overview

Kickoff is a Symfony Console application distributed as a global Composer package that bootstraps new
Laravel projects with opinionated conventions, packages, and project structure. It automates the setup
of development tools, testing frameworks, deployment scripts, and standardized project architecture.
